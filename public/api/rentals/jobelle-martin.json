      "description": "Jobelle moved from the Philippines to Halifax in 2007 to study I.T. and web development at Nova Scotia Community College. She started at Torusoft as a student intern with limited practical knowledge and experience. Almost a decade later, Jobelle has amassed an impressive, ever-expanding set of design, layout and coding skills, and has become an indispensable part of every web project we ship."
